              I specialize in creating responsive, user-centric web interfaces using the latest web technologies such as
              <span className="highlight"> HTML5</span>, <span className="highlight">CSS3</span>, and <span className="highlight">JavaScript</span>,
              and frameworks like <span className="highlight">Bootstrap</span> for rapid UI development. My focus is on building visually engaging,
              fast-loading, and mobile-friendly websites that deliver seamless experiences across all devices. With extensive experience in frameworks like
              <span className="highlight"> React.js</span>, I craft dynamic and interactive user interfaces that are not only intuitive but also highly performant.
              I leverage Reactâ€™s component-based architecture to build reusable and maintainable code, ensuring scalability and consistency.
              Additionally, I use tools like <span className="highlight">Redux</span> for efficient state management and <span className="highlight">TanStack Query</span>
              for data fetching and synchronization, allowing me to build responsive applications that handle real-time data with ease.

              I specialize in designing secure, scalable, and efficient back-end systems using
              <span className="highlight"> Node.js</span> and <span className="highlight">Express.js</span>, along with other popular technologies.
              I focus on creating robust <span className="highlight">API architectures</span> that ensure fast, reliable, and secure communication
              between the front-end and back-end of web applications. With a strong emphasis on security best practices, I implement authentication
              and authorization using <span className="highlight">JWT (JSON Web Tokens)</span>, ensuring safe user access control. Additionally,
              I handle file uploads seamlessly using <span className="highlight">Multer</span>, enabling smooth integration of file management in applications.
              For email functionality, I integrate <span className="highlight">Nodemailer</span> to send reliable transactional emails, such as registration
              confirmations and password resets.
